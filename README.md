        * For each type of argument made by the opposition which type of argument are best to refute it.

        * Find for which type of arguments do we have the best and most credible data sources

        * Create a strategy map.

            * Factual Inaccuracy provided as a argument.

            * Factual Inaccuracy in the sources provided by opposition can be used to question any of the sources credibility.

                * Regional Preferences while gathering data.
